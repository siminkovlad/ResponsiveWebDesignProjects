                    <h2>Some information about TØP:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The band was formed in 2009 by lead vocalist Tyler Joseph along with Nick Thomas and
                            Chris Salih, both of whom left in 2011. Since their departure, the line-up has consisted
                            of Joseph and drummer Josh Dun.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The group received a Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 59th Annual
                            Grammy Awards.

                        <li>
                            The band independently released two albums, Twenty One Pilots (2009) and Regional at
                            Best (2011), before being signed by record label Fueled by Ramen in 2012.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Their label debut, Vessel, was released in 2013.

                        <li>
                            The duo achieved breakthrough success with their fourth album, Blurryface (2015), which
                            produced the successful singles "Stressed Out" and "Ride" and became the first album in
                            history on which every track received at least a gold certification from the Recording
                            Industry Association of America.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The release of the single "Heathens" also made the group the first alternative artist
                            to have two concurrent top ten singles in the United States.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The duo's fifth studio album, Trench, was released on October 5, 2018.

                            The band's musical style has been described as alternative hip hop, electropop, indie

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Joseph and Dun attribute this style to their background as independent and self-taught
                            musicians who played the music they enjoyed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Joseph came up with the band's name while studying All My Sons by Arthur Miller, a play
                            about a man whose decision, sending out faulty airplane parts for the good of his business
                            and family, has caused the death of twenty-one pilots during World War II.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The band's name was originally stylized as "twenty | one | pilots" on their earlier
                            cover art; however, by the time of their second album, Regional at Best, the formatting
                            was changed to "twenty øne piløts" with a diagonal line through the Os.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The band's fandom has been dubbed as the "Skeleton Clique" or just the Clique,
                            in reference to the band's use of skeleton iconography in many performances, graphics,
                            and music videos.
